# Numdiff-Project2
Matlabcode for project 2 in the course Numerical methods for differential equations

This is another test subject in order to get a better understanding for Github. 
Project 2 concerns 2 point boundary value problems, Sturm-Liouville is a method that is able to calculate several important differential equations.
